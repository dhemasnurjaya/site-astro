When I create a new Flutter project targeting Android device, I can't choose which Android device to run it. Either it a real connected devices or AVDs, even the devices is available and listed in `Device Manager` tab.

All I need to do is open `File > Project Structure...` or `Ctrl + Alt + Shift + S`.

As you can see, I have no Android SDK selected for my Flutter project. So, go ahead and select one of SDK listed there and click `OK`. That's it! Now you can see all the devices available to run my Flutter project.

Hope this can help someone who has similar issues with Flutter project and Android devices.
