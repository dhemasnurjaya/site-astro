  <PageTitle title="Hi, I'm Dhemas 👋" />
  <p class="mb-4">
    Cross-platform developer. Linux fan stuck on Windows. Craftsman at heart.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    I write about building apps, learning new tech, and the occasional
    existential crisis that comes with debugging production code. This is where
    I share what I'm working on, what I'm learning, and thoughts that don't fit
    in a commit message.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Currently working at a local startup where "full-stack" means Flutter 📱,
    Spring ☕, and React Router 🌐—sometimes all in the same day. I follow The
    Craftsman's Way: quality is not negotiable. Clean Architecture, TDD, and DDD
    aren't just buzzwords here; they're how I try to keep my sanity intact.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Also, I built this blog with Astro ⚡ because life's too short for slow
    websites.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-8">
    Stick around if you're into cross-platform dev, software craftsmanship, or
    just want to see someone figure things out in public. 🚀
